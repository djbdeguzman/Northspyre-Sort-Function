# Northspyre-Sort-Function

Created by Jette(https://github.com/djbdeguzman) for Northspyre's CS team PH use only.

I am part of the Northspyre's Customer Success team Ph, and continuously contributing to the team's success.
Since I am learning how to code, I decided to create this function to make lives of the CS team easy.

this code will sort projects with pending data in All Portfolio Incoming Costs
This will add new div, ul and li for the list of pending data in the cost inbox

Instruction on how to use the code for our convenience:
1. in your browser press "F12" to open developer tools
2. Click "console"
3. pase the code in the console and press enter
4. close console and you will notice the list of the projects will be displayed on top of the website under the header
